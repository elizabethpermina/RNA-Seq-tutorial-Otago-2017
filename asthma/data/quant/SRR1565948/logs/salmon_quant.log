[2017-06-21 10:49:59.137] [jointLog] [info] Computed 67715 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-06-21 10:49:59.137] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4428644 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-06-21 10:49:59.167] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4428644 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
